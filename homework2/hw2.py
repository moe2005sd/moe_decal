# 1) Suppose your current working directory is ~/Desktop/classes/python_decal/. What command would allow you to navigate directly to ~/Desktop?
#    cd ../..
# 2) What does ~/ mean?
#    The path to the beginning of a directory.
# 3) What's the difference between and abolute and a relative path in your terminal?
#    Absolute path is the full path from root or home directory, while relative path is based on the current directory.
# 4) What command would bring you back to your home directory?
#    cd ~
# 5) If you called rm ./ in your current working directory, what would it do?
#    It would do nothing because rm means deleting or removing a file/directory but ./ means current directory and it's not possible or allowed to delete the directory I'm currently in.
# 6) In your current working directory, what does calling "git add" do? What about "git commit"? What about "git push"?
#    "git add" adds code to the git staging area (makes a rough draft). "git commit" saves changes to the local repository with a message required. "git push" uploads code to the remote GitHub repository.
# 7) Let's say you call "git add" in your current working directory and then "git status". What message would appear? What is it telling you?
#    On branch main   nothing to commit, working tree clean. It's telling me that there's nothing to commit yet since I didn't put anything to add.
# 8) What has been the most frustrating error or bug you've encountered in this class so far? How did you troubleshoot and resolve it?
#    Not showing outputs in VS code. Yes.
# 9) How does cloning a repository differ from pulling from a repository?
#    Cloning is copying someone else's repository content and pasting it into mine, but pulling is getting contents from my own GitHub repository and putting them into my local computer repository.
# 10) Tell me a fun fact!
#     I'm Japanese nationality but Chinese blooded!
